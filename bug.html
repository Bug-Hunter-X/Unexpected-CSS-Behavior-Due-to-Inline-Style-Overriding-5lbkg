<p>This is a demonstration of an uncommon HTML bug.  Imagine you have a nested structure where you're using both inline styles and external stylesheets. The inline style might inadvertently override a crucial style defined in your external stylesheet, leading to unexpected visual results. This might not be immediately apparent as the cascade might appear to work as expected in some instances but cause problems in others.</p><p>For example, consider the following:</p><code><div style="color: red;" class="my-element"></div></code><p>In the external stylesheet (styles.css):</p><code>.my-element {color: blue; font-size: 16px;}</code><p>Even though the stylesheet specifies blue text color and a specific font size, the inline style overrides the color to red.  The specificity of inline styles often makes them hard to debug.</p>
